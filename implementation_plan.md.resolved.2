# Secure Remote PTZ Camera Control System - Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Develop a secure, remote PTZ camera control system using Firebase Realtime Database as a bridge. The system features a Node.js local client (compiled to Windows .exe) that connects Panasonic cameras to the cloud without port forwarding.
**Key Features:**
- **Room-Based Access:** Unique Room ID and Password for authentication (Zero-Knowledge: Password verified locally).
- **Security:** Strict Command Allowlist, Anti-Malware protection, and Watchdog timer (Auto-Stop on connection loss).
- **Ease of Use:** Local GUI for initial setup and Single Executable packaging.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Password Handling:** Passwords are **never** stored in the cloud. The Client verifies passwords locally for every command. If the Client is restarted or the config is lost, the "Room" effectively becomes inaccessible until reconfigured with the same password.

> [!WARNING]
> **Single User per Room Recommendation:** While the system supports multiple controllers, for safety reasons (physical movement conflicts), it is recommended to coordinate control access. The system actively processes commands on a "Last Write Wins" basis.

### [server] Node.js Client
### [server] Desktop Client (Electron)
#### [NEW] [main.js](file:///server/main.js)
- **App Lifecycle:** Create Tray icon, handle window visibility (show/hide).
- **Background Services:**
    - Run Express Server for Local Web GUI (kept separate for cleanliness).
    - Manage Firebase Connection & Watchdog.
    - Perform Camera Auto-Discovery.
- **IPC Communication:** Bridge status updates (IP, Device Count, Online Users) to the Dashboard Window.

#### [NEW] [dashboard.html](file:///server/dashboard.html)
- **Design:** Compact "Bitfocus Companion" style window.
- **Metrics:** Display Local IP, PTZ Count, Connection Status (Green/Red), Online Users.
- **Controls:**
    - [Open GUI]: Launches system default browser to `http://localhost:{port}`.
    - [Hide]: Minimizes window to System Tray.

#### [NEW] [gui.js](file:///server/gui.js)
- Express server logic remains largely the same.
- Serves the configuration page (`index.html`) to the external browser.
- **In-Memory Config:** Variables stored in `main.js` Global State, accessible via IPC.

#### [NEW] [security.js](file:///server/security.js)
- Logic unchanged: `verifyCommand`, `sanitizeCommand`, `watchdog`.
- Integrated into `main.js` flow.

### [firebase] Configuration
#### [NEW] [database.rules.json](file:///firebase/database.rules.json)
- Rules to allow any authenticated user (or public, if relying entirely on Room ID knowledge + Local Pass) to write to `commands` but strictly validate structure.
- **Decision:** Use Firebase Anonymous Auth for basic rate limiting, but rely on Local Client for "Access Control" via Password.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- **Unit Tests (`server/test/security.test.js`):**
    - Test `verifyCommand` with correct/incorrect passwords.
    - Test `sanitizeCommand` with valid/malicious payloads.
- **Integration Test (`server/test/mock_firebase.js`):**
    - Simulate Firebase messages and verify Client triggers Camera HTTP requests (mocked).

### Manual Verification
1. **Setup:**
   - Run `node server/index.js`.
   - Verify Browser opens.
   - Enter Room `TEST01`, Pass `1234`.
2. **Connection:**
   - Check Console: "Connected to Room TEST01".
3. **Control:**
   - Use a simple script (or the provided test web page) to push `{ cmd: 'PAN_LEFT', password: '1234' }` to Firebase.
   - Verify Client logs: "Executing PAN_LEFT".
   - Stop sending commands. Verify Client logs: "Watchdog Triggered: STOP".
4. **Security:**
   - Push `{ cmd: 'PAN_LEFT', password: 'WRONG' }`.
   - Verify Client logs: "Auth Failed".
   - Push `{ cmd: 'RM_RF', password: '1234' }`.
   - Verify Client logs: "Invalid Command".
